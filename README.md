Project Overview

Blaze-AD-Automation is a **PowerShell automation framework** that provisions Active Directory in alignment with the **Cisco Blaze network model** (City â†’ Department).  
It enables IT administrators to quickly deploy and standardize:

- Organizational Units (OUs) reflecting physical sites and departments
- Global (GG) and Domain Local (DL) security groups for RBAC
- User accounts with role-based group assignments
- Home folders and departmental shares with NTFS ACLs
- SMB shares for both departments and individual users
- CSV audit reports for compliance and documentation

This ensures consistency between **network topology (Cisco Blaze)** and **directory services (Active Directory)**, simplifying administration and improving security.
